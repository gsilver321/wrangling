        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "  This paper focuses on data tidying, which is a subset of the data cleaning process. It describes how using this framework can provide tidy and consistent data structures that are easy to analyze/visualize.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The \"tidy data standard\" intends to facilitate data exploration and analysis. By providing a standardized way to clean data, cleaning data should become easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first sentence is trying to illustrate that while tidy datasets all share similar traits due to their standardized cleaning process, messy datasets might have their own unique challenges that distinguish them from other datasets and make cleaning harder. The second sentence is describing how it's often easy to visualize data with a matrix (i.e. rows=observations, columns=variables), but understanding what the values are actually describing can be difficult because the table was created with a specific purpose in mind. Someone who is just looking at the data for the first time might not be able to discern the true meaning behind the data names, making data cleaning difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Wickham defines values as numbers or strings, variables as all values that measure the same attribute across units, and observations as all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"Tidy Data\" is defined as a dataset where each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The five most common problems with messy datasets are column headers that are values and not variable names, multiple variables being stored in one column, variables being stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units being stored in the same table, and a single observational unit being stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 is messy because the column names are values that the variable could take (e.g. $10-20k) instead of a variable name like income. \"Melting\" a dataset involves turning column variables into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because it lists different days (d1-d8) as column headers when they should all be grouped under a single variable or placed in their own respective table. Table 12a is \"molten\" because it condenses the days into a variable called date. By removing the variable names from the element category in Table 12a, we get a tidy Table 12b where the table entries are attributes instead of variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  When tidying data, the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem can be described by the link between tidy data and the tools that use tidy data. If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then those tools will be promoted instead of the tidy data cleaning approach. Wickham hopes that in the future, the tidy data framework will help others create better tools and data storage strategies."
